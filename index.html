  <h2> Spider Man </h2>
  <p> This is my number one because this game has everthing it has a good story line, the side mission make sense and are relabled sometimes they also teach you a lot about the story. They have good fighting mechanics. You can forget about the swinging mechanics its so smooth and runs nice there no lag or delay. To get the Platinum trophy on this game is really easy the hardest trophy to get is to beat the game on the hardest mode.</p>
  <h2> Days Gone </h2>
  <p> This is my number 2 because I got my dad to play it and he loved it. He hates game that take long to finsh but he finshed this gaame when he was on vacation.In a week he finshed it. Now I got Platinum trophy but it took me 3 months. The game is about a zombie apocalypse that started. The main character Deacon Lee St. John lead his wife who was a scientist to a choopper. So she can fix this virus. 2 years past Deacon thinks she dies but shes alive and finds her. But in the middle of that there is a camp that kicks Deacon out. So he kills all of them and thats the end. The side missions are ok I mean there just beating emimes and helping camps but there fun. You get a motorcycle you can ride on which is a lot of fun but you need gas for it. The game makers made it easy to find gas. You can upgrade your bike and change the appearance by doing side missions. the game is smooth, the map is big and fun to explore, and the weapons are creative.</p>
